This is the code for the paper "Interpretable decision trees to predict solution fitness" by Catalano et al.

The code in main is to produce the experimental data, which can then be processed by VarianceDecisionTree\process_data\accuracy_by_settings.ipynb.


If you would like to use this methodology, please contact me at (email obfuscated to avoid spam) g\dot\a\dot\catalano\at\stir\dot\ac\dot\uk

(The intention is to clean up this code and unify my work into one nice repository, but unfortunately my research process is branching and full of dead ends...
